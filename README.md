[00:10.50] Remember that night
[00:13.17] I had to leave you
[00:15.49] You said it's alright
[00:17.91] And I believed you
[00:20.38] You know I'm no good
[00:22.73] No good at goodbyes
[00:25.21] No good without you
[00:27.48] Better by your side
[00:32.20] Wish I could be there with you
[00:37.64] I'm feeling lost without you
[00:41.19] In this empty bed
[00:43.78] Where I'm all alone
[00:46.12] I've been such a mess
[00:48.59] Need a one way ticket
[00:50.93] Anywhere you are
[00:53.42] Is where I want to go
[00:55.82] You are my address
[00:58.48] I don't care how I get it
[01:01.39] Need a one way ticket home (oh)
[01:06.30] Need a one way ticket home (oh)
[01:12.00] When you're not with me
[01:14.31] These days are boring
[01:16.85] Wish it were easy
[01:19.00] Like Sunday morning
[01:21.13] When I'd be waking up with you
[01:24.00] Only doing those things we wanna do
[01:26.33] My heart is anywhere you go
[01:29.26] When I'm next to you I'm home
[01:33.83] Wish I could be there with you
[01:38.70] I'm feeling lost without you
[01:42.49] In this empty bed
[01:44.80] Where I'm all alone
[01:47.36] I've been such a mess
[01:50.30] Need a one way ticket
[01:52.21] Anywhere you are
[01:54.63] Is where I want to go
[01:57.27] You are my address
[02:00.20] I don't care how I get it
[02:02.65] Need a one way ticket home (oh)
[02:07.89] Need a one way ticket home (oh)
[02:12.30] One way ticket home (oh)
[02:17.07] Need a one way ticket home (oh)
[02:23.66] (Ooh, ooh)
[02:28.52] (Ooh, ooh)
[02:33.50] In this empty bed
[02:36.49] Where I'm all alone
[02:39.04] I've been such a mess
[02:41.52] (I've been such a mess)
[02:45.93] In this empty bed
[02:48.69] Where I'm all alone
[02:51.32] I've been such a mess
[02:53.90] Need a one way ticket
[02:55.89] Anywhere you are
[02:58.54] Is where I want to go
[03:01.20] You are my address
[03:03.91] I don't care how I get it
[03:06.15] Need a one way ticket home (oh)
[03:11.52] One way ticket home (oh)
[03:15.97] I need a one way ticket home (oh)
[03:20.61] Oh! Ooh, ooh
[03:26.07] I don't care how I get it
[03:28.22] Need a one way ticket home
